# Java-Helper-Functions
This repository will provide some useful helper functions for java if new to the language. Some will reduce efficiency, so for complex programs I recommend not using this tool.


## How to Use

Simply place the files in src in your source directory and inherit AssadFunctions.
```
public class Main extends AssadFunctions {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //call any functions here
    }
    
 }
```
