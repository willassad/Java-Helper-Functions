# Java-Helper-Functions
Some useful helper functions in java if new to the language. Some reduce efficiency, so for complex programs I recommend not using this tool.

```
public class Main extends AssadFunctions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //call any functions here
    }
 }
```
